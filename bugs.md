After adding a meeting it's some seconds before the button is enabled again and I can do another meeting, it should be instantly

The loading time to load tasks/meetings is really long

It's really long until I see any change, I see queued and nothing is happening. Is this really queued or maybe processing and it's refreshing issue?

Assigned people can be only from /data/voices people. Noone else can be assigned. Diarization should compare voices to /data/voices. Instead I see "Alex" assigned to task. WTF

There are a lot of refreshing issues - I change sth in one view that should be visible in second view but it is not, i have to refresh manually then
